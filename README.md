This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Description

[My-Bank](https://my-bank-six.vercel.app/) is an online banking web app using all CRUD functions.
The app allows users to create an account and perfrom several operations. At registration it automatically assigns a "Check account" to the user, he/she can directly make a deposit, create a business or saving account.
The user can also make a transfer to one of his/her other account and make a payment to another user account on the app.

## Technologies

- JavaScript, for dynamic and interactive web pages and to execute complex actions.

- Next.js (React.js Framework), for server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, and a straightforward routing system, resulting in better performance and improved user experience.

- Bootstrap, styling components by providing a set of pre-designed and customizable UI components like buttons, forms, and breadcrumbs, which allowed me to create a visually appealing and consistent front-end for this app.

- SCSS, for a more organized and modular way to write CSS, making it easier to manage styles and maintain a consistent design across the application.

- MongoDb, for a flexible and scalable NoSQL database, enabling efficient storage and retrieval of user account data, transactions, and other financial information.

- Node.js, to build the backend of the application with ease, handle HTTP requests, and interact with the database for user authentication and data processing.

- iron-session, to secure and encrypt session management, allowing me to handle user authentication and store sensitive session data on the server securely.
